            <p>Climate Change threatens plants and animals, food supply, clean air and water. 
                Climate Change, as you might have guessed, is not a joke. We have to do our 
                best to stop it, because if we don't, it will be bad for not only amimals and 
                plants, but for us.</p> <img class="one" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1570358934836-6802981e481e?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80" alt="OneWorld">

    <h1><b>Animals</b></h1> 
    <div>
        <p>More that a million animals 
            are at risk from climate change,
             and could go extinct. This
              is not good, as we are the 
              ones causing this. Scientists 
              predict that by mid-century,
               30 to 50% of all animals on
                earth will have gone extinct.</p>

                            By the year 2030, scientists say that some effects of climate change 
                            are going to be irreversible.
