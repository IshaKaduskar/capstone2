         Yes, you know about climate change, 
         but how can you slow it down? <br> We started
          this, we end this. Below is a list of things 
          YOU can do to help climate change.</p>

        <h1> <b>Reduce water</b> </h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>Reducing your water can help to reduce carbon pollution. 
                How? It takes energy to power your water. Yes, that tap 
                you accidently left on for a long time not only makes your 
                floor soaking, it uses up so much energy. You can help save 
                water by turning the tap of when not needed and taking quick
                 showers</p>

    <h1><b>Carpool</b> </h1> 
    <div class="list" class="right">
         <p>Do you know, that <b id="bold">28.8</b> of U.S greenhouse gas emissions are 
          caused by transportation? Cars and buses cause so many emissions,
          and we don't need all that pollution in the air. Instead, what YOU 
          can do, is carpool when you can with your friends. You can also take
          walkes instead of rides, or just bike to your destination. This was,
          you get stronger, AND you get more fresh air, that hopefully stays
          clean fresh because you chose to go green.   </p>

                    <h1><b>Unplug</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        Unpluging is important. Why? Because if you have a device thats
                         fully charged and still pluged into a charger, thats nothing but 
                         wasting energy. Its all charged, it can't take any more. What can
                          YOU do to save aall this energy? Yes. You can only plug in devices 
                          if they need to be charged, and remove them when done. You can 
                          also skip pluging in devices that you use less often, or you rarely use.
                           This was, not only are you saving your electricity bills, you are
                            also saving our planet. Good job!

                    <h1><b>Buy the food you NEED</b></h1>
                    <p>When you buy food, make sure you eat it, for
                      three reasons. Reason number 1, it is 
                     enviormentaly friendly. It takes a lot of energy
                    to grow, process, package and ship all of your
                      food. Reason number two, 40% of that shipped 
                       food ends up in the landfill. What a waste of
                     energy! Reason number 3, a lot of people who
                       don't have enough money to feed themselvesor
                      their family... and to think 40% of that food 
                   ends up in the landfill! Only buy what you need, 
                 and please don't waste food.  </p>
